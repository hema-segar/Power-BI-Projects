# Crop Yield Predictor

**Project Description:**  
This project aims to predict crop yields based on historical data and environmental factors. It helps farmers and agricultural businesses optimize crop planning, manage resources efficiently, and make data-driven decisions. The tool uses machine learning algorithms to forecast yields, taking into account factors. Python was used to build the predictive model, leveraging libraries like scikit-learn for modeling, and pandas for data manipulation.

## 1 - Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to create a Power BI dashboard to visualize crop data, identify trends of import and export value and predict the future crop yield based onhistorical data to make data-driven decisions on trade partnerships between countries.
